This repository demonstrates a common C programming error involving dangling pointers and attempting to free memory allocated on the stack. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from trying to free a pointer that points to stack memory, leading to undefined behavior and potential crashes. The solution illustrates how to correctly manage memory allocation and deallocation in C to avoid such issues.
